### Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
1. Run `python src/main.py` to start the game
2. Use WASD keys to move around the map
3. Encounter enemies randomly based on your position
4. Choose to attack or flee during combat
5. Gain XP and level up your character
5. Survive as many turns as possible!
